Task 7 : Why A* Algorithm? Possible Heuristic for Travelling Student Problem:

What would have been the number of nodes visited in case we used a simple Shortest Path Problem Algorithm like Dijikstra's?
- 
Also in case the problem would have required you to reach multiple nodes what possible heuristic can you come up with for A*?
