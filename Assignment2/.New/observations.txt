ASSIGNMENT 2:
1)	taskSquare Minimal Topology:
		out_nodes = 2
		alpha = 0.15
		batchSize = 15
		epochs = 20
		seed = 1
		
		nn1.addLayer(FullyConnectedLayer(2, 4))
		nn1.addLayer(FullyConnectedLayer(4, 2))

		Test Accuracy	98.5 %


2)	taskSemiCircle Minimal Topology:
		out_nodes = 2
		alpha = 0.05
		batchSize = 30
		epochs = 20
		seed = 2

		nn1.addLayer(FullyConnectedLayer(2, 2))
		nn1.addLayer(FullyConnectedLayer(2, 2))

		Test Accuracy  97.7 %


3)	taskMNIST:
	
	Minimal Topology:
		out_nodes = 10
		alpha = 0.01
		batchSize = 5
		epochs = 15
		seed = 3

		nn1.addLayer(FullyConnectedLayer(784, 9))
		nn1.addLayer(FullyConnectedLayer(9, 10))

		Test Accuracy	91.44 %

	But I am using following topology, just to have a safer side for some random seed value which might cause problems:
		
		out_nodes = 10
		alpha = 0.02
		batchSize = 5
		epochs = 15
		seed = 3

		nn1.addLayer(FullyConnectedLayer(784, 12))
		nn1.addLayer(FullyConnectedLayer(12, 10))

		Test Accuracy	92.2 %

	

4)	taskCIFAR10:
	Since, there is no clear definition of minimal topology as several types of layer with several parameters are involved. I am considering this one as somewhat minimal. ALso, it would have taken days of training to find a minimal topology even if the definition of topology is clear. 

		out_nodes = 10
		alpha = 0.1
		batchSize = 20
		epochs = 30
		seed = 4

		Training Size 		10000
		Validation Size 	1000
		Testing Size 		1000

		nn1.addLayer(ConvolutionLayer([3, 32, 32], [4, 4], 4, 2))
		nn1.addLayer(AvgPoolingLayer([4, 15, 15], [3, 3], 3))
		nn1.addLayer(FlattenLayer())
		nn1.addLayer(FullyConnectedLayer(100, 25))
		nn1.addLayer(FullyConnectedLayer(25, 10))

		Test Accuracy	45.9 %
