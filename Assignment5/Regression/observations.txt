Ridge Gradient Descent:
    lambda = 12.429
    Final SSE on test data = 540303471169.8229
Lasso Gradient Descent:
    lambda = 
    Final SSE on test data = 

SSE v/s lambda plot helps us in figuring out where the minima of the SSE v/s lambda curve lies.
After getting the minima, we get an estimate of the vicinity of optimal lambda. Then we repeat the curve for lambdas in that vicinity.
