     TASK 2
================


1. Run your code on datasets/garden.csv, with different values of k. Looking at the performance plots, does the SSE of k-means algorithm ever increase as the iterations are made? (1 mark)
Answer:

3. Look at the files 3lines.png and mouse.png. Manually draw cluster boundaries around the 3 clusters visible in each file (no need to submit the hand drawn clusters). Test the k-means algorithm on the datasets datasets/3lines.csv and datasets/mouse.csv. How does the algorithm’s clustering compare with the clustering you would do by hand? Why do you think this happens? (1 mark)

     TASK 3
================

1. For each dataset, with kmeansplusplus initialization algorithm, report “average SSE” and "average iterations". Explain the results. (2 mark)
Answer:

Dataset     |  Initialization | Average SSE  | Average Iterations

1. Can you observe from the visualization that k-medians algorithm is more robust to outliers as compared to k-means? Why do you think this happens? (1.5 marks)

  TASK 8
================

1. What do you observe as we reduce the number of clusters (k)? Answer in reference to the quality of decompressed image. (0.5 mark)
Answer:


2. You can observe that for the small number of clusters, the degree of compression (original size/compressed size) is about the same as that of when we use larger number of clusters even though we need to store lesser number of colors. Can you tell why? How can we increase this ratio in case of smaller number of clusters? [1 mark]
