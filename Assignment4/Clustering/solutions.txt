1. Run your code on datasets/garden.csv, with different values of k. Looking at the performance plots, does the SSE of k-means algorithm ever increase as the iterations are made? (1 mark)
Answer: No, it never increases. Theoretically it should not increase ever.

3. Look at the files 3lines.png and mouse.png. Manually draw cluster boundaries around the 3 clusters visible in each file (no need to submit the hand drawn clusters). Test the k-means algorithm on the datasets datasets/3lines.csv and datasets/mouse.csv. How does the algorithm’s clustering compare with the clustering you would do by hand? Why do you think this happens? (1 mark)

     TASK 3
================

1. For each dataset, with kmeansplusplus initialization algorithm, report “average SSE” and "average iterations". Explain the results. (2 mark)
Answer: 

Dataset     |  Initialization | Average SSE  | Average Iterations

   100.csv  |        forgy    |8472.63311469| 2.43

  TASK 4
================

1. Can you observe from the visualization that k-medians algorithm is more robust to outliers as compared to k-means? Why do you think this happens? (1.5 marks)
Answer: k-medians is more robust to outliers as compared to k-means.

  TASK 8
================

1. What do you observe as we reduce the number of clusters (k)? Answer in reference to the quality of decompressed image. (0.5 mark)
Answer: As we reduce the number of clusters the quality of decompressed image reduces since we have to represent same image using lesser number of colours.


2. You can observe that for the small number of clusters, the degree of compression (original size/compressed size) is about the same as that of when we use larger number of clusters even though we need to store lesser number of colors. Can you tell why? How can we increase this ratio in case of smaller number of clusters? [1 mark]
